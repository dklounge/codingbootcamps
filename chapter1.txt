# Chapter One

This is an example chapter of a Leanpub book.  To start your book, simply replace the content of this file with your writing, and then go to your book page on Leanpub and click on the Preview tab to make a preview of your book.

Briefly, to write a Leanpub book, you write a bunch of plain text files, all in the same folder as this file.  These text files are written in a format called Markdown, which is a simple way of doing formatting that lets you focus on your writing.

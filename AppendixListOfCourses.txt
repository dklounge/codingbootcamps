`*` Refund is usually applied if a job is accepted through a school.

**Note**: this list was composed in the summer of 2013 and information in it is subject to change, please check with the schools' website for a more update information.


We've gathered the following information:

* Name

* Website: find the most up-to-date information and apply to the courses.

* Facebook: follow recent updates and social connection.

* Twitter: follow recent updates and ask questions.

* Location: where do you want to spend 2-3 months, and possibly land a job.

* Length: trade-off between learning and necessary financial-mental stamina. 

* Hours per week: for out-of-town folks the more hours per week/day is advantageous, because they don't have to spend as much on housing/food.

* Tuition Price: check website for most up-to-date information.

* Refund: Some schools offer refunds.

* Focus: the main tech stack to learn and master. Most courses cover the basics of web development (HTML and CSS) and incorporate several programming languages. However, many differ in their emphasis of fundamental computer science theory and more advanced back-end technologies.

* Class Size: the less people is better, if the number of instructors is limited, otherwise there is a magic camaraderie with batches of 15-30. This is usually inversely related to the tuition price.

* Hiring Placement Support: does the Programming Course offer official help with job placement?

* Location: where do you want to spend 2-3 months and possible land a job

* Length: the longer is the better but only if have enough financial and mental stamina 

* Hours per week: the more the better (same as length), for out-of-town folks the more hours per week/day is advantageous because they don't have to spend as much on housing/food

* Tuition Price: you get what you pay for, right?

* Refund: Some schools offer refunds and they're usually applied if a job is accepted through a school.

* Focus: the main tech stach to learn and master. Most courses cover the basics of web development as HTML and CSS but differ in the fundamental CS topics and back-end technologies.

* Class Size: the less people is better, if the number of instructors is limited, otherwise there is a magic camaraderie with batches of 15-30. This is usually inversely related to the tuition price.

FAQ

1. How likely am I to get a job after a programming bootcamp without a CS degree?

* Shawn Drost, Co-founder of Hack Reactor (San Francisco)
> 
> Very likely.  Most students at our program don't have CS degrees, and the hiring rates that you're seeing online are an accurate representation of your odds of getting a job.
>
> The underlying issue here is that it's very, very hard to hire good programmers, and if you're able to pick up some new skills, you'll be in great demand, regardless of your credentials.

* Jeff Casimir, Principal at Jumpstart Lab
> 
> It's very realistic. 100% of our graduates have been hired into full-time, full-salary development positions.
>
> If you graduate from a training program, earn their stamp of approval, and aren't inundated with job offers you should demand your money back.

2. How much will I make in my job as web developer or software engineer?


3. Wait. Is there a difference between a web developer and software engineer?  What is the difference?


4. Why are some Programming Bootcamps free?

* Michael Kaiser-Nyman, co-founder of Epicodus (Portland, Oregon)
>
> The only "free" program I know of is App Academy; you pay them 15% of your salary for 6 months once you get a job.
>
> I run Epicodus, a 4-month coding school that costs $2,800. It's really important to me to keep tuition affordable, and if you can't pay up-front, we'll help you get a loan.

* Hacker School (New York City)
>
> Hacker School is free as in beer. This is possible because startups pay us to recruit. If after Hacker School you want a job, we will help you however we can. If you don't want one, or you'd prefer to search on your own, that's fine too.

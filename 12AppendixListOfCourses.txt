Key Programming Languages: Ruby & Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, CSS3/HTML5

Other info: We focus on learning programming. The languages, libraries, and frameworks we use are a means to an end - learning how to think like a programmer. By the end of the course, students are well-prepared to learn whatever languages and tools come their way on the job.

Here are a few things I think make Epicodus special:

* Almost 100% of our classroom time is spent pair programming, so students spend as much time as possible actually coding and collaborating.

* Students gradually build up their skills from simple web pages, to using Javascript for interactivity, to writing pure Ruby apps, to finally building full-stack web apps. They develop a solid understanding of each layer before they move to the next.

* There's a heavy emphasis on learning how to think like a programmer by using object-oriented design and test-driven development, and by learning in two languages, Javascript and Ruby.

* Students finish the class by building real-world applications for actual clients.

* Students of all skill levels and backgrounds are welcome.

## A Toolkit for Your Decision

This brief guide is a tool to help inform your decision about whether to attend an intense full-time programming school.

The gulf between quitting your day job and enrolling in a full-time programming school is a large one. And for the more intense programs, it could mean a drastic life change - moving to a new City, working long hours learning late into night, and plunging into a new career path. For some of you, the change would be a night-and-day from the current 9-to-5. It's a big decision, alright.

You are reading this guide, because you want to be better informed.  You do not want to spend next several months of your life and upwards of $10,000 of investment only to be unemployed, or worse, to regret your decision and still be uncetain about what you want out of life and career. That's why we wrote this guide. We have an insider's perspective to programming schools and to the wider high-tech scene.  We have seen applicants across various career stages and learning process. And we want to help inform you so that you can make a good decision.

Don't misunderstand the purpose of this guide. Only you can decide what you want out of life! Our role is simply to furnish you with constructive thoughts and useful information to help you in your journey. To that end, our goals are:

1. Provide general overview of Programming Schools and their context

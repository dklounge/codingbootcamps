# Applications Checklist

## Your journey

There is no right or wrong as you take this journey. That said, we hope you make the most informed decision possible. What are some steps you can take to remove some risks in your decision making and obtain more information and comfort?

## Checklist template

We suggest you invest in your own list of key factors of your decision. Nevertheless, the following baseline should be included in your list.

1. [ ] Check the school reputation online - Quora, Reddit, Hacker News, YouTube Channels.

2. [ ] Ask the school officials what are the standards of admission.

3. [ ] Ask the school officials about the culture of the learning environment.

4. [ ] Ask the alumni and assess their experience, if possible (there are plenty of blogs to read). Alumni are, in many ways, the most accurate indicator of the quality and experience within the programming course.

5. [ ] Ask about payment options - how flexible are they?

6. [ ] Remember, location is very important when it comes to hiring and salary.

7. [ ] Where are the alumni working, and what are companies that recruit regularly through the Programming School?

8. [ ] Your own gut check - does it feel right? Does it seem to align with your next career or life direction?b

## Guide to Choosing a Full-time Coding Bootcamp

### By David Kim

This is a brief guide for those considering whether to attend an intense, full-time coding bootcamp. You may hear others describe it as a hacker school or programming school.

### Target audience

Basically, it is a big leap to quit your day job, and enroll in a full-time Coding Program. Should you take the plunge? For some, this guide will begin to paint the questions that one should ask before going into a coding bootcamp. A key content is alumni and school profile collected via surveys.

If you already are coding a lot and have made up the mind to attend, then the book probably will add little value for you.

Sample to the published book can be found on Leanpub as pdf: [Coding Bootcamps Sample](http://samples.leanpub.com/coding-bootcamps-sample.pdf)

### Introduction

The gulf between quitting your day job and enrolling full-time in a programming school is a large one. You are reading this guide, because you want to be better informed. After all, you do not want to spend next three months of your life and upward of $10,000 of investment only to be unemployed, or worse, to regret your decision and still be unsure about what you want out of life and career. That's why we wrote this guide. We have an insider's perspective to programming schools, and have seen applicants from across a broad spectrum. And we want to help inform you so that you can make a good decision.

Let us say that one more time. Only you can decide what you want out of life. Our role is simply to inform you. To that end, our goals in this guide are as follows:

1. Provide general overview of Programming Schools to set context
2. Identify and aggregate pertinent information to save you time
3. Share profiles of alumni to better inform you about the outcomes
4. Objectively rank the top US programs so that you are better informed

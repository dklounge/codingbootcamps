_Don't try to be another 'Nat.' Be you, be 'David.' - An advice from a friend_

Back in February of 2013, we hosted a panel event featuring 8 alumni from San Francisco programming schools. It was organized to help a local programming community members ask questions from those who knew best.

It was a [Q&A meetup event](http://www.meetup.com/sfruby/events/104937692/), and while we do not repeat the questions asked during that event here, we hope that the following stories and information will help answer questions you have on your mind.

_Don't try to be another 'Nat.' Be you, be 'David.' - A friend_

Back in February of 2013, we hosted a panel event featuring 8 alumni from four San Francisco programming courses. It was organized to help local programming community members ask questions from those who had been through the 'bootcamp' experience.

It was a [Q&A meetup event](http://www.meetup.com/sfruby/events/104937692/), and while we do not repeat the questions asked during that event here, we hope that the following stories and information will help answer questions you have on your mind.

* What is your favorite memory from the Program?

>The day before I had to present my personal project to the rest of the class. It was a day off, and I spent the whole day getting my project as solid as possible for the presentation. It was really exciting to be able to make tangible progress quickly. At that point, I had been learning in the intensive environment of Hack Reactor for a long time, and I had been working on that particular project for quite a while, too, so I was able to make fast progress.
>

* Tell us a story around your decision to attend.  What were your goals?

>I wanted to move from working in stores to a more professional career. I wanted to get more satisfying work. I expected Hack Reactor to speed me along that path.
>

* And why did you choose your particular school?

>It was longer and more intensive than the other programs, namely Dev Bootcamp. I liked its focus on the front end, too.
>

* What is #1 reason you would recommend that someone should attend your school?

>You learn a lot faster than if you try to learn more independently.
>

* What were you doing before attending?

>Seeing the increasing complexity of things I can build.
>

* Tell us a story around your decision to attend.  What were your goals?

>

* And why did you choose your particular school?

>The curriculum was heavily project focused but the primary differentiator was just the ability to get me into an early cohort.
>

* What is your favorite memory from the Program?

>The moment my script worked the way I wanted it to for the first time was exhilarating.
>

* Tell us a story around your decision to attend.  What were your goals?

>I just wanted to be able to build stuff myself. I'd always been interested in tech, and since my original career goal wasn't working out, I felt drawn towards programming. 
>

* And why did you choose your particular school?

>I chose Hackbright because it cost less (at that point), it was women-only, and they let me in.
>

* What is #1 reason you would recommend that someone should attend your school?

>The community is rallying around Hackbright, so it is more than a technical education. You also get a lot of advice and help maneuvering through tech careers as a woman.
>

* What were you doing before attending?

>Community Management (glorified sales for a startup)
>

* What programming languages did the (official) curriculum cover?

>Python, Flask, SQLite, RegEx, JavaScript, Ruby (no Rails), HTML, CSS

FAQ

1. How likely am I to get a job after a programming bootcamp without a CS degree?
* Shawn Drost - co-founder of Hack Reactor:
> Very likely.  Most students at our program don't have CS degrees, and the hiring rates that you're seeing online are an accurate representation of your odds of getting a job.
>
> The underlying issue here is that it's very, very hard to hire good programmers, and if you're able to pick up some new skills, you'll be in great demand, regardless of your credentials.

* Jeff Casimir - Principal at Jumpstart Lab
> It's very realistic. 100% of our graduates have been hired into full-time, full-salary development positions.
>
> If you graduate from a training program, earn their stamp of approval, and aren't inundated with job offers you should demand your money back.
